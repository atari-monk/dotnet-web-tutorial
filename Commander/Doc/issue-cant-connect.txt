Rather than use IP addresses, which would be problematic in a team environment, you can also use host.docker.internal which will resolve to your host IP.
Data Source=host.docker.internal,1433;Initial Catalog=MyDB;User ID=MyUser;Password=MyPassword
//for docker compose
var defaultServer = @"host.docker.internal\sqlserver";
//for mannual migration
var defaultServer = "localhost";
