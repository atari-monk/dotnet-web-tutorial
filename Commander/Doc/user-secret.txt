dotnet user-secrets init (to add guid for secrets key, to proj file, secrets are stored in some system appdata folder)

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/managing-schemas/migrations/?tabs=dotnet-core-cli
dotnet ef database update (add sufficent permissions to dblogin)
run api and test connection to db by typing your endpoint in the browser
but better to use config, to build connection string, for dockerizing
dotnet user-secrets list
